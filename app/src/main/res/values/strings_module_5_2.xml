    <string name="module5_2_1_content_1">In this lesson, we dive into the fascinating connection
between derivations in formal grammars and their corresponding parse trees. Whether you’re exploring
syntax in programming languages or delving into computational linguistics, mastering this relationship
will provide deeper insights into how structures are formed and represented. Join us as we unravel the
complexities of this critical aspect of formal language theory, breaking it down into easy-to-understand
concepts with visual aids and practical examples.</string>

    <string name="module5_2_2_content_1">This lesson explains the relationship between derivations
and parse trees in the context of formal grammars. A derivation shows the step-by-step process of
generating a string, while a parse tree graphically represents the hierarchical structure of that derivation.
The lesson covers the construction of both leftmost and rightmost derivations and how they map to
parse trees, reinforcing key concepts through examples.</string>
    <string name="module5_2_2_content_2">Basic Examples:</string>
    <string name="module5_2_2_content_3">Derivation Example:</string>
    <string name="module5_2_2_content_4">Starting with the initial symbol S, we may derive the string
"a + b" by applying production rules one by one, such as S→E→E+E→a+b</string>
    <string name="module5_2_2_content_5">Parse Tree Example:</string>

    <string name="module5_2_2_content_6">The parse tree for this derivation would have S as the root,
branching into nodes representing the operators and operands, visually depicting the structure of the
expression "a + b."</string>
